            <em>Friends</em> is a hit American sitcom created by David Crane and
            Marta Kauffman, that aired from 1994 to 2004 for a total of ten
            seasons. It stared Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green), Courtney Cox
            (Monica Geller), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matt Le Blanc (Joey
            Tribbiani), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing), and David Schwimmer (Ross
            Geller). Some fun real-life facts about the cast! 
            <br> 
            1. Courtney Cox was just like Monica in real life. 
            <br> 
            2. Phoebe and Chandler were originally written as supporting roles - not main characters! 
            <br> 
            3. There was an intervention for Jennifer Anistonâ€™s tardiness. David Schwimmer kindly informed her of this <em>issue</em>.
